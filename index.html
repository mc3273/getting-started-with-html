<p></p><b><span style="color:#0000FF"> I: The Basics of the Web </b></b>
<p><br>Overview - HTML,URLS,HTTP, and Web Applications</br></p>
<br><b> World Wide Web </b></br>
</br>1) You, your PC Browser </br>2) The Internet- The worlds largest Computer Network  </br>3) HTTP Requests - Protocal to communitcate with servers <br> 4) Connected to servers - hosting files in a remote location</br>
<br><b> HTML - HyperText Mark Up Language </b>
</br>1) Text Content - What you See! <img src="http://content.mycutegraphics.com/graphics/health/cartoon-eyes.png" style="max-width:5%;" alt="Smile">
</br>2) Mark Up - what it looks like 
</br>3) Reference to other docs - e.g. images, pictures, or video's'</br>
<br> Misc - made up as tags  (E.G. < NAME> Contents </NAME>)     (Opening tag and closing tag, closing has an extra line, entire thing is considered an element, not adding a closing tag leaves the code open and it continues on...</br>
<br><b> Sample Tags  </b></br>
</br>First Tag - "b" with an open and close e.g.  </b><b> contents </b>  = BOLD TEXT 
<br> Second Tag - "em" with an open and close  e.g. "<em> contents </em>  = ITALICS
<br> Third Tag - Hyperlink  " a ref "  E.G.   Hello <a href= "www.apple.com">APPLE</a>   - This tags creates a hyperlink to apple 
<br> Fourth Tag - break tag "br" with an open and close "- line break creates additional lines 

<br> Fifth Tag - Paragraph tag "pr" with an open and close "- Paragraph - not a void tage   content, tag creates a new paragraph </br>

What he said about block elements creating "invisible boxes" will be important, but you will learn more about this in the next lesson.

<p></p> <b>Container elements:</b> elements that do nothing but contain stuff inside of them. The purpose of these elements will not be clear yet, but in the next lesson you will see how these elements can be used to create web pages with complex structures.

<p> <b>Lesson Summary </b></p> The five most important things to take from this lesson are the following:

<br> 1 - What a Web Page is

A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.

<br> 2 - How Coding Works

Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote. For example, the computer might do this by making text like this:

I'm <b>learning</b> to code!

look like this:

I'm learning to code!

<br> 3 - Computers are Stupid

Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax").

For example, if you forget to close a bold tag, the computer won't be able to figure out what you had intended to make bold. This "stupidity" can be very frustrating, but it also gives programmers incredible power: if you know how to talk to a computer than you can tell it do do anything you want.

<br> 4 - Programmers Can't Remember Everything

There are too many details to keep everything in your head. And that's okay. If you forget how to make text italic in HTML, you can always just look it up.

<br> 5 - Basic HTML Vocabulary

<br><br>You will be using HTML in the next few lessons, so it will be helpful if you're comfortable with the jargon.</br>

<br> <b>Tag: </b> An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag (" p " ' for example) and a closing tag, ("p"). Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag (like the "br" tag).</br>

<br> <b>Element:</b> An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.</br>

<br> <b> Attribute:  </b> This is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set the href attribute of an anchor tag to the Udacity URL,  " a href="www.udacity.com"  </br>

<p> Span and Div will be used often in this class! Span is Inline and Div is a block element </p>
